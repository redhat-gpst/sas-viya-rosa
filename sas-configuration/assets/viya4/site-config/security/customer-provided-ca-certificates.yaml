## Example ConfigMapGenerator to generate the ConfigMap containing customer provided trusted CA Certificates
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ CA-CERTIFICATE-FILE-NAME }}"
## should be replaced by the path to a .pem file containing your ca certificate(s).
## If you use the suggested example, the correct, final syntax would be:
## - site-config/security/cacerts/trustedcerts.pem
##
##
apiVersion: builtin
kind: ConfigMapGenerator
metadata:
  name: sas-customer-provided-ca-certificates
behavior: merge
files:
#
#
## List of one or more files containing the CA certificates to be added to trust bundles used by SAS applications
##   * the files must be in pem format
##   * the path to the files should be relative to the directory that contains the kustomization.yaml file
##   * one file per line.  The files themselves can contain multiple certificates in pem file syntax
##
- site-config/security/cacerts/le-isrgrootx1.pem # For example, site-config/security/cacerts/trustedcerts.pem
- site-config/security/cacerts/le-r3.pem
